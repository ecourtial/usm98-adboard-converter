USM98 Textures Manager

1) Description

This small application is designed to help you to edit various textures in the game.
So far, you can edit:
- Adboards

Further features will be added over the time

Special thanks to Dane Smallbone who took a lot of time to create this color palette and understood how
Adboards are stored.

A CSV palette is given containing the RGB values that are used by the game. You can used a fancy software
to edit the BMP files, but the old fashioned MS Paint will perfectly do the job.

2) Installation

You need Java installed on your computer (java.com/en/download).
Then, move all the files wherever you want, in any specific folder of your computer.
Personally, I have a "USM98-Tools" directory  on my Desktop where I put all the USM98 tools I use, for instance
the USM Tweaker.

You need to have both the files USM98-Textures-1.0.jar and USM-Colour-Palette.csv together in the same folder.

Note: I developed this application and tested it with USM98-99 (aka USM98 v2). I have no idea if it works
with the previous version.

3) Utilization

Double click on the M98-Textures-1.0.jar fil. The application will start.

3.1) Adboards

To export the adboards into a BMP file, just copy the Adboards.spr file from the game folder into the folder
you put the textures manager. Then click on the corresponding button to export it into a BMP file.

To do the opposite, you obvisouly  need to have your BMP file (Adboards.bmp) in the folder. Just click in the other
button to export it into a SPR file and copy the new file into the USM folder.
